# Ongoing Musical Design

## Step 1: Introduction 
Goal: The design and the music must be on forever!

First, drag the ``||Basic:show icon||`` block into your ``||Basic: on start||`` block. 



## Step 2: Test out the songs!
Scroll through the music catergory and drag in the ``||Music:play melody dadadum in background||``.

You can change the song by clicking on ``||Music:melody dadadum||`` dropdown menu and choosing the song of your choice.

To test out if it is a song that you will like, try it out by clicking the start/stop simulator button underneath the console. 


## Step 3: Troubleshoot!
The design is still lit, but the music is played once and stops. We want it to play forever!

Let's see if moving everything to the forever block helps. Drag the ``||Basic:show icon||``  block to move everything over to the forever block.

Test your code! What is happening now?

## Step 4: Solve the problem!
Explore other options! 
Maybe you can move something to ``||Basic:on start||`` instead? 

Perhaps you need to switch the order of the two blocks?

Are there any other dropdown menus in our blocks that will help you solve the problem?

 
## Step 5: Design challenge
Yay! The problem is fixed! 

Replace the ``||Basic:show icon||`` with the ``||Basic:show string||`` block. 

How can we have both the words and the music go on forever?
